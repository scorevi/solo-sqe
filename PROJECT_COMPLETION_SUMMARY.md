### Database Schema
```sql
User (id, name, email, password, role, createdAt, updatedAt)
ComputerLab (id, name, location, capacity, description, createdAt, updatedAt)
Computer (id, name, specifications, labId, createdAt, updatedAt)
Booking (id, userId, labId, computerId, startTime, endTime, purpose, status, createdAt, updatedAt)
```

### Quality Assurance & Testing
- **Jest + React Testing Library** for unit testing
- **Cypress** for end-to-end testing
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality and formatting
- **Husky** for pre-commit hooks
- **GitHub Actions** CI/CD pipeline
- **TypeScript** strict mode for type safety
